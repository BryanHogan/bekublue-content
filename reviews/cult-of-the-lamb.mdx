Cult of the Lamb is a fun mix between two different genres, live action when exploring dungeons and building your own village / cult.

## Explore dungeons & grow your cult

The dungeon exploring part reminded me of The Binding of Isaac, although you don't get as crazy combinations of builds you still a nice variety of weapons and perks that you get that keep the game interesting. There are 4 different main dungeons which you explore in multiple runs each as you progress the story.

In the other half you build up your village and manage your new followers that you recruit during a run in the dungeons. You gather resources, build new building, do rituals and gain permanent upgrades for your dungeon runs.

This is the core game loop, you get resources and followers in your runs and use these to further upgrade your village which in turn unlocks new things and makes you stronger.

## Made by who?

Cult of the Lamb has been developed by Massive Monster, an indie studio with only smaller prior releases.

## My experience

## Conclusion - How good & who should play Cult of the Lamb?

Cult of the Lamb sits at a 95% positive rating in Steam, which I find deserved.
