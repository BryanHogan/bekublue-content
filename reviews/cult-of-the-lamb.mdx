**Cult of the Lamb** combines action roguelite combat with light base management mechanics. Explore dungeons, bring back followers and resources, use them to grow your cult.

## Explore dungeons & grow your cult

The dungeon sections are runs through randomized rooms. You fight enemies with melee weapons and spells, pick up temporary upgrades, and face bosses. The structure is similar to *The Binding of Isaac*, though more limited in terms of build depth. There’s enough variety in weapons and upgrades to keep runs interesting, but it’s not a theorycraft-heavy game.

Outside of combat, you manage your cult. You build structures, assign jobs, handle follower needs like hunger and dissent, and unlock passive upgrades. Progress in one half of the game supports the other: followers and resources from combat fuel your cult, and cult upgrades improve your dungeon runs.

This core loop is simple but effective, and both sides of the game are easy to grasp. The base building isn’t very deep, but it’s well-paced and works well between runs.

## Made by who?

Cult of the Lamb has been developed by Massive Monster, an indie studio with only smaller prior releases.

## My experience

## Conclusion - How good & who should play Cult of the Lamb?

*Cult of the Lamb* is a solid game. It doesn’t go deep in any one system, but the balance between dungeon crawling and cult management is well-executed.


Cult of the Lamb sits at a 95% positive rating in Steam, which I find deserved.
