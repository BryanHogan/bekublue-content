Dome Keeper presents a refreshingly different twist on the mining genre by combining elements of resource management, survival, and roguelike gameplay into one addictive loop. Developed by Bippinbits, this game places you in the role of a dome defender on an alien planet, mining for resources while fending off waves of hostile creatures attacking your dome.  
With vibrant pixel art and a compelling soundtrack, Dome Keeper offers a nostalgic yet modern experience that keeps you on edge as you dig deeper into the planet’s core.
Gameplay

At its heart, Dome Keeper is a blend of mining and tower defense.  
You descend below the surface, carving through layers of rock to discover materials that can be used to upgrade your equipment or fortify your dome. There’s an exhilarating rhythm in the transition between mining and combat—moments where you are scrambling to gather just a few more resources before rushing back to fend off enemies. You have to prioritize: dig for the valuable resources or return to defend your dome.

The game’s roguelike elements enhance replayability, with each playthrough offering randomized resource locations and unique upgrades. The upgrade tree is fairly robust, letting you tailor your loadout to your preferred playstyle. Want to be a mining powerhouse? Invest in your drill and jetpack upgrades. Prefer a defensive play? Prioritize weapon upgrades for the dome itself.
Aesthetic and Atmosphere

Visually, Dome Keeper nails the retro look, with pixel art that feels both charming and eerie. The subterranean world is dark and claustrophobic, providing a sense of foreboding as you dig further down, knowing that each trip down means more time away from the dome. The audio design amplifies the tension, with minimalistic sound cues that immerse you in the stillness below or the frenzied battle above.
Challenges and Replayability

The game’s main challenge lies in balancing mining efficiency with survival skills. As you progress, waves of enemies become tougher, requiring strategic upgrades and skilled resource management. The roguelike structure and randomized layouts add great replayability, encouraging you to explore different build paths and strategies with each run.
