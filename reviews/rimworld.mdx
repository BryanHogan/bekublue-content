 Rimworld is a special game. The creator doesn't even call it a game, he calls it a "Story Generator".

 ## What is Rimworld about?

In Rimworld you manage your colonists, and these colonists are unique, they have different strengths, backgrounds, traits and more. This will mean that some of your colonists will focus on different things such as cooking, construction, farming, combat or more. But that is not all, some might prefer staying indoors, eating other humans, or are unable to do *dumb* labor. 

## Wild stories & funny tragedies

## My experience

I originally dismissed Rimworld. I tried it once, and stopped playing after a few minutes. Then I tried again, and stopped quite quick.

But after reading Tynan Sylvester's book on game design, the creator of Rimworld, I found new motivation to try once more. Maybe it were the better tutorials that had been added by then, or my new mindset, but this time I found the game much more enjoyable. I found it helpful to not try to understand everything, to not go too deep into optimisation, and to just enjoy tragedies.

## Problems

Although Rimworld is fun it is not without its problems.

It's hard to get into. The game is complex with many complex systems, it takes time to understand what really matters. Many aspects of this game also don't help in understanding it, the UI could be much better, e.g. which crops you are supposed to grow for food. You are overloaded for options and numbers, when in reality you have to choose between three that only differ in yield and growth length.

It's not visually appealing. The simple and non detailed art style is a great decision, since this allows the creation of the complex systems quickly. Details of interactions and events are left to the players imagination, which is a good thing. By sticking to a simple art style and communicating more detailed states and events through interfaces the gameplay is improved.  
But nonetheless, visually the game doesn't look amazing, and that has nothing to do with the smart decision for a simple art style.

It gets repetitive. ....
