 Rimworld is a special game. The creator calls it a "Story Generator".

 - similar games: dwarf fortress, songs of styx
 - had a hard time getting into it, its ui isn't great and it does look a bit ugly, some part of this is even intended, and when I first tried it I just didn't understand it
 - got into it, now its great
